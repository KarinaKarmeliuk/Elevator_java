Using:
1. Run 'Building.main()'
2. Run 'UserControlPanel.main()'

Comments:
- There is only one CallHandler which can work with only one user-control-panel in this program. 
- User-control-panel can be closed by user program command during 'Building.main()' is running. 
- Then user can run again 'UserControlPanel.main()' for the same running 'Building.main()'.
